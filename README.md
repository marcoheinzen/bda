# BDA - Battlefield Damage Assessment
## Battlefield Damage Assessment in European Conflict Zones Using Multimodal (RGB + SAR) Satellite Images and Deep Neural Networks

Battlefield Damage Assessment (BDA) of urban structures lies at the intersection of Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) and remote sensing, where the interpretation of imagery supports decision-making in conflict zones. The historical trajectory of GEOINT shows how mapping, remote sensing, and geoinformatics converged into an intelligence discipline focused on actionable situational awareness (Clark, 2020). Foundational texts such as Introduction to Remote Sensing (James B. Campbell & Randolph H. Wynne, 2011), Remote Sensing: Digital Image Analysis (Richards, 2022), and Introduction to Microwave Remote Sensing (Woodhouse, 2017) provide the remote sensing and microwave principles on which GEOINT builds (Clark, 2020; O’Connor, 2024).
Armed conflicts in urban areas cause widespread destruction of civilian and military infrastructure (Armed Conflict in the East of Ukraine, 2019; Garzón & Valánszki, 2020). The consequences extend beyond the immediate battlefield, shaping humanitarian crises, civil protection, economic decision-making, and strategic military planning (Aimaiti et al., 2022; Armed Conflict in the East of Ukraine, 2019). Urban damage assessment in post-disaster and conflict zones has therefore gained urgency due to the scale, complexity, and geopolitical significance of recent crises (Endo et al., 2018; Plank, 2014). Accurate and timely information on the state of urban structures is vital not only for humanitarian relief and reconstruction but also for situational awareness and battlefield decision-making (Benson & Ecker, 2020).

In European conflict theaters such as the Second World War, the Balkans, and, more recently, Ukraine, large-scale destruction of housing and infrastructure has forced millions to flee, creating humanitarian emergencies across the (Armed Conflict in the East of Ukraine, 2019; Garzón & Valánszki, 2020). Rapid and reliable evaluation of structural damage is thus a critical capability for both defense and civil protection organizations (Butenko & Petrychenko, 2023; Clark, 2020; Shelestov et al., 2023). International actors, including the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), rely on objective situational awareness to estimate displacement, coordinate aid, and prioritize reconstruction (European Union, 2025; ICRC, 2025; Ukraine Conflict Monitor ACLED, 2025; UN, 2025; UNOSAT, n.d.). For Switzerland, a country committed to neutrality, humanitarian aid, and diplomacy, and as the host of major international organizations, remote sensing provides a means to support neutral yet informed responses to crises.

Remote sensing has long enabled the monitoring of large areas without physical access: from balloons in the First World War and aerial reconnaissance in the Second, to Cold War military satellites and the launch of Landsat-1 in 1972 (James B. Campbell & Randolph H. Wynne, 2011). Since then, Earth observation has evolved into a multidisciplinary field encompassing optical, thermal, multispectral, hyperspectral, and radar sensors. Of particular importance are synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, which operate independently of daylight and can penetrate clouds, enabling all-weather, day-and-night monitoring (Flores et al., 2019). In parallel, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have transformed automated image interpretation. Early pixel-based classifiers have been supplanted by object-based approaches and deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), encoder–decoder architectures like U-Net, and more recent generative and graph-based models (Chen et al., 2022; Ronneberger et al., 2015).

The objective of this literature overview is to consolidate the state of knowledge on remote sensing and AI methods for battlefield damage assessment of urban structures. It situates existing work from the disaster and conflict monitoring domains, analyzes available sensors and datasets, and evaluates machine learning approaches for structural damage detection. By integrating insights from both civilian disaster management and defense-oriented studies, the review highlights the dual-use nature of these methods and establishes a scientific foundation for their application to conflict-related damage assessment in European theaters of operation.

From a civil protection perspective, rapid damage assessment after natural disasters is essential for directing emergency services and estimating losses. UAV-based mapping, such as the surveys conducted by Swisstopo after the landslide in Blatten (Lötschental), demonstrates how local authorities can quickly identify destroyed buildings and allocate resources efficiently. Such methods are also valuable for insurance companies in cost estimation. Although this thesis primarily addresses conflict-related applications, the methodological parallels with natural disaster management underline the dual-use value of remote sensing and AI (Swisstopo Fliegt Rapid-Mapping-Einsatz Bei Blatten, 2025).

From a military and intelligence perspective, damage assessment provides independent, global insight into conflict progression. Satellite imagery—optical, multispectral, hyperspectral, or radar-based—enables analysts to identify destroyed urban areas, assess whether roads and bridges remain functional, and evaluate how infrastructure damage constrains both civilian and military mobility. For friendly forces, such information supports tactical planning, emergency response, urban operations, and post-conflict stabilization. For adversaries, assessments reveal whether occupied structures remain usable or whether destroyed supply routes impede maneuverability. Beyond tactical applications, such intelligence supports strategic evaluations of conflict progression, enabling states to anticipate humanitarian flows, economic disruption, and security dynamics (Clark, 2020; O’Connor, 2024).

The foundation of automated assessment workflows lies in the acquisition and comparison of pre- and post-event imagery. Very high resolution (VHR) optical satellites provide detailed coverage, while radar platforms ensure all-weather monitoring. SAR interferometry (InSAR) adds depth by capturing subtle deformations invisible to optical sensors (Richards, 2022). Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery support land-use classification and enable the targeting of analysis to defined areas of interest, reducing computational requirements (James B. Campbell & Randolph H. Wynne, 2011; Jensen, 2016; Richards, 2022). Benchmark datasets such as xBD (Gupta et al., 2019) and SpaceNet (Etten et al., 2018) are widely used to train and validate models, but conflict-specific datasets are increasingly recognized as essential for transferability across urban morphologies (Benson & Ecker, 2020; Scher & Van Den Hoek, 2025). Robust preprocessing - including image co-registration, domain shift correction, indexing, and land-use classification - ensures comparability across timeframes and sensors (Meyer, 2019; Zhu et al., 2017). Dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA, autoencoders) and filtering approaches further reduce noise and extract meaningful features (Green et al., 1998; Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006; I. T. Jolliffe, 2002; Richards, 2022).

Recent advances in deep learning architectures have expanded the possibilities of urban damage detection. CNNs (Su et al., 2020), U-Nets (Wu et al., 2021), Siamese networks (Khvedchenya & Gabruseva, 2021), Swin Transformers (Cui et al., 2023), and attention-based frameworks (Hao et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022) enable precise footprint extraction and multi-class damage classification (Taiwo H. Agbaje et al., 2024; L. Wang et al., 2024). Transfer learning (Bouchard et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2024), GAN-based augmentation (Su et al., 2020), and multimodal fusion (optical + SAR) improve robustness across regions and disaster types (Adriano et al., 2021; Endo et al., 2018), while hyperparameter optimization enhances generalization (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Outputs are increasingly delivered as GIS-compatible layers—polygon segmentations and ordinal damage scales—that integrate into situational awareness platforms such as QGIS, GeoServer (Calantropio et al., 2021), or web dashboards (Chawanji et al., 2022; UNOSAT, n.d.). Emerging developments include 3D structural modeling (Fernández Galarreta et al. 2015), near-real-time UAV analytics (Alphonse et al., 2023; Calantropio et al., 2021; Hewawiththi et al., 2024; Kerle et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), and cloud-integrated ML pipelines (Dietrich et al., 2025). Yet, these methods highlight the problem of transferability: most models are trained on globally diverse datasets such as xBD, which suffer from class imbalance (Benson & Ecker, 2020; Gupta et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020) and underrepresentation of European building typologies (Al Shafian et al., 2025; Y. Wang et al., 2022).

ML models have already achieved strong results in natural disaster contexts, including earthquake (Cui et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2018; Qing et al., 2022; Rao et al., 2023; Voigt et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2023; ZHAO Jinling, 2024), hurricane (Cao & Choe, 2020, 2024; Cheng et al., 2021; P. Li et al., 2024; Y. Li et al., 2018a, 2018b) and wildfire damage mapping (Kang et al., 2025). Since 2018, emerging studies have begun to address conflict-related damage assessment directly, applying RS and ML approaches to Syria (Braun, 2018; Casana & Laugier, 2017; Joy-Fares, n.d.; Lubin & Saleem, 2019, 2019), Iraq (Boloorani et al., 2021), and Ukraine (Aimaiti et al., 2022; Butenko & Petrychenko, 2023; Dietrich et al., 2025; Kholoshyn et al., 2023; Scher & Van Den Hoek, 2025), often using Sentinel-1/2 and WorldView imagery. UNOSAT products are frequently employed as reference data for validation (Chawanji et al., 2022; UNOSAT, n.d.). However, this literature remains limited compared to civilian disaster studies. Much of the methodological foundation stems from natural-disaster assessments. By contrast, battlefield monitoring faces contested access, deliberate denial and deception measures, and sometimes active jamming of optical and radar systems (Clark, 2020; O’Connor, 2024). 

Major challenges remain. Data scarcity and limited labeled datasets - particularly in European conflict zones - restrict model generalization. Domain adaptation is a persistent bottleneck, as models trained on one region or conflict often underperform in new geographies (Benson & Ecker, 2020). Urban heterogeneity, partial destruction, and the lack of annotated datasets covering non-building infrastructure (roads, bridges, utilities) further complicate operational deployment. In conclusion, this literature overview underscores the potential of combining remote sensing and AI for rapid, accurate, and scalable battlefield damage assessment. By integrating humanitarian, civil protection, and defense intelligence perspectives, and by systematically reviewing sensors, datasets, and algorithms, the study bridges the gap between academic innovation and operational readiness in conflict-sensitive environments.
